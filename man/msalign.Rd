\title{Multiple alignment}
\usage{
msalign(fsa.tbl, machine = "microseq::muscle")
}
\arguments{
\item{fsa.tbl}{A fasta object (data.frame or tibble) with input sequences.}

\item{machine}{Function that does the 'dirty work'.}
}
\value{
Results are returned as a fasta object, i.e. a tibble with columns
\samp{Header} and \samp{Sequence}.
}
\description{
Quickly computing a smallish multiple sequence alignment.
}
\details{
This function computes a multiple sequence alignment given a set of sequences in
a fasta object, see \code{\link{readFasta}} for more on fasta objects.

It is merely a wrapper for the function named in \code{machine} to avoid explicit writing
and reading of files. This function should only be used for small data sets, since no result
files are stored. For heavier jobs, use the \code{machine} function directly.

At present, the only \code{machine} function implemented is \code{\link{muscle}}, but other
third-party \code{machine}s may be included later.

Note that this function will run \code{\link{muscle}} with default settings, which is fine
for small data sets.
