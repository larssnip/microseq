\title{Read and write FASTA files}
\usage{
readFasta(in.file)
writeFasta(fdta, out.file, width = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{in.file}{url/directory/name of (gzipped) FASTA file to read.}

\item{fdta}{A \code{\link{tibble}} with sequence data, see \sQuote{Details} below.}

\item{out.file}{Name of (gzipped) FASTA file to create.}

\item{width}{Number of characters per line, or 0 for no linebreaks.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{readFasta}} returns a \code{\link{tibble}} with the contents of the (gzipped) FASTA
file stored in two columns of text. The first, named \samp{Header}, contains
the headerlines and the second, named \samp{Sequence}, contains the sequences.

\code{\link{writeFasta}} produces a (gzipped) FASTA file.
}
\description{
Reads and writes biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) in the FASTA format.
}
\details{
These functions handle input/output of sequences in the commonly used FASTA format.
For every sequence it is presumed there is one Header-line starting with a \sQuote{>}. If
filenames (\code{in.file} or \code{out.file}) have the extension \code{.gz} they will automatically be
compressed/uncompressed.

The sequences are stored in a \code{\link{tibble}}, opening up all the possibilities in R for
fast and easy manipulations. The content of the file is stored as two columns, \samp{Header}
and \samp{Sequence}. If other columns are added, these will be ignored by \code{\link{writeFasta}}.

The default \code{width = 0} in \code{\link{writeFasta}} results in no linebreaks in the sequences
(one sequence per line).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# We need a FASTA-file to read, here is one example file:
fa.file <- file.path(file.path(path.package("microseq"),"extdata"),"small.ffn")

# Read and write
fdta <- readFasta(fa.file)
ok <- writeFasta(fdta[4:5,], out.file = "delete_me.fasta")

# Make use of dplyr to copy parts of the file to another file
readFasta(fa.file) \%>\% 
  filter(str_detect(Sequence, "TGA$")) \%>\% 
  writeFasta(out.file = "TGAstop.fasta", width = 80) -> ok
